            <h1>Life According to Klay</h1>
            <p>"Life According to Klay" is my final project in art class in the Hebrew Reali School of Haifa. It is a sculpture of my height, made out of wood, plaster, and plasticine.</p> 
            <p>The sculpture is a model of a small world, divided into foor parts, which are connected through "doors", so you could actually walk around this world if you were little enough.</p>
            <p>The design and art are inspired from the game "The Neverhood" by Doug TenNapel.</p>
